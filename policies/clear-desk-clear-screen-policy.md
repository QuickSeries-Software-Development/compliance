# Clear Desk and Clear Screen Policy

## Purpose, scope and users

The purpose of this document is to define rules to prevent unauthorized
access to information in workplaces, as well as to shared facilities and
equipment.

This document is applied to the entire Information Security Management
System (ISMS) scope, i.e. to all workplaces, facilities and equipment
located within the ISMS scope.

Users of this document are all employees of QuickSeries Publishing.

## Reference documents

- ISO/IEC 27001 standard, clauses A.7.7 and A.8.1

- ISMS Policy

- Information Classification Policy

## Clear desk and clear screen policy

All information classified as "Internal use," "Restricted" and
"Confidential" as specified in the Information Classification Policy
are regarded as sensitive in this Clear Desk and Clear Screen Policy.

### Workplace protection

#### Clear desk policy

If the authorized person is not at his/her workplace, all paper
documents, as well as mobile (endpoint) devices and data storage media
labeled as sensitive, must be removed from the desk or other places
(printers, fax machines, photocopiers, etc.) to prevent unauthorized
access.

Such documents, mobile devices, and media must be stored in a secure
manner in accordance with the Information Classification Policy. When
documents and storage media are no longer required, they must be
disposed of in accordance with the Disposal and Destruction Policy.

#### Clear screen policy

If the authorized person is not at his/her workplace, all sensitive
information must be removed from the screen, and access must be denied
to all systems for which the person has authorization.

In the case of short absence (up to 15 minutes), the clear screen policy
is implemented by logging out of all systems or locking the screen with
a password.

Information on whiteboards (e.g., those available in meeting rooms) must
be cleared when no longer required.

### Protection of shared facilities and equipment

Documents containing sensitive information must immediately be removed
from printers, fax and copy machines.

Facilities for dispatch and reception of mail at our headquarter office
are protected by the warehouse manager who keeps it at his desk.

Virtual fax machine is forwarding received faxes by email to our VP
sales. The VP sales then dispatch them accordingly.

Prior to leaving facilities for a longer period (e.g. Holidays) or
permanently, a detailed inspection of rooms, offices, and furniture in
them must be performed to ensure no QuickSeries Publishing assets are
left behind.
