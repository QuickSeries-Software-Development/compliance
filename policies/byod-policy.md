# Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy

## Purpose, scope and users

The purpose of this document is to define how QuickSeries Publishing
will retain control over its information while such information is being
accessed through devices that are not owned by the organization.

This document is applied to all personally owned devices that have the
ability to store, transfer or process any sensitive information from the
Information Security Management System (ISMS) scope. Those devices
include laptops, smart phones, tablets, USB memory sticks, digital
cameras, etc. Such devices will be referred to as BYOD in this Policy.

Users of this document are all employees of QuickSeries Publishing.

## Reference documents

- ISO/IEC 27001 standard, Annex A controls A.5.14, A.6.7, and A.8.1

## Security rules for using BYOD

The rules in this Policy apply to all BYOD, whether they are used for
work or for private use, or whether they are used within or outside of
the organization's premises.

### Company policy

By default, QuickSeries restricts the use of BYOD. Only a limited number
of managers and some employees who wouldn't be able to perform work
otherwise are allowed to use a personal device, under the condition that
QuickSeries deploys an MDM business profile on it.

The company data and intellectual property that is stored, transferred,
or processed on BYOD remains under the company's ownership, and the
company retains the right to control such data and/or intellectual
property even though it is not the owner of the device.

### Who is allowed to use BYOD, and for what

IT Director will create a List of job titles and/or persons who are
allowed to use BYOD, together with the applications and databases they
are allowed to access with their own devices.

IT Director will create a List of BYOD-prohibited applications.

### Which devices are allowed

IT Director will create a List of acceptable devices which can be used
as BYOD, together with mandatory settings for each device.

### Acceptable use

For each BYOD, the following are mandatory:

- QuickSeries will deploy a business profile through MDM to the BYOD, in
  order to enforce control of certain apps and security policies.

- The apps installed are:

  - Slack

  - Gmail

  - Google Drive

- When enrolled with a business profile, the designated apps on the BYOD
  are only to be used with a QuickSeries account.

- Whenever necessary, the business profile will also include a VPN
  profile to allow certain user to connect to the company
  infrastructure.

- when using BYOD outside of the company premises, it must not be left
  unattended and, if possible, should be physically locked away.

- when using BYOD in public places, the owner must take care that data
  cannot be read by unauthorized persons.

- patches and updates must be installed regularly.

- classified information must be additionally protected according to the
  Information Classification Policy

- notify the IT department before BYOD is being disposed of, sold, or
  handed to a third party for servicing

It is not allowed to do the following with BYOD:

- allow access to anyone else except the employee who is the owner of
  the device

- install applications that are listed in List of BYOD-prohibited
  applications

- locally store passwords, except when using the following applications:

  - Slack

  - Gmail

  - Google Drive

- locally store the following information in the context of their work:

  - Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

  - Credit Card Information (CCI)

  - Federal Contract Information (FCI)

  - Any other information that QuickSeries or our clients may consider
    sensitive (e.g. source material for our guides,
    classified/unclassified information, etc.)

- transfer company data to other devices which are not allowed

### Special rights

QuickSeries Publishing has the right to view, edit, and delete all
company data that is stored, transferred or processed on BYOD.

The IT Director is authorized to configure any BYOD according to this
Policy and monitor its use via the Miradore MDM service.

QuickSeries Publishing has the right to perform full deletion of all
data on BYOD if it considers that necessary for the protection of the
company data, without the consent of the device owner.

### Reimbursement

QuickSeries Publishing will not pay the employees (the owners of BYOD)
any fee for using the device for work purposes.

### Security breaches

All security breaches related to BYOD must be reported immediately to
the IT Director. Further, all weaknesses that have not yet become
incidents must be reported through the same channels within 1 business
day.

### Training and awareness

The IT Director is in charge of training new and existing employees on
appropriate use of BYOD, as well as raising awareness about the most
common threats.
