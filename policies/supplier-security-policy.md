## Relationship with suppliers and partners

### Identifying the risks

Security risks related to suppliers and partners, including the
providers of cloud services, are identified during the risk assessment
process, as defined in the Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment
Methodology. During the risk assessment, special care must be taken to
identify risks related to information and communication technology, as
well as risks related to product supply chain.

The CEO decides whether it is necessary to additionally assess risks
related to individual suppliers or partners.

### Screening

The CEO decides whether it is necessary to perform background
verification checks for individual suppliers and partners, and if yes --
which methods must be used. [TBD]

### Contracts

The CEO is responsible for deciding which security clauses will be
included in the contract with a supplier or partner. Such decision must
be based on the results of risk assessment and treatment.

The following clauses are mandatory in the agreements with suppliers:

- Keeping the confidentiality of the information

- Return of assets after the termination of the agreement

- How the information about threats is communicated between the supplier
  and the buyer

- Ensuring a reliable delivery of the products and services, which is
  particularly important with cloud service providers

A list of suggested clauses is given in appendix Security Clauses for
Suppliers and Partners.

[Job title] will decide whether the individual employees of the
supplier/partner will have to sign the Confidentiality Statements when
working for QuickSeries Publishing.

[Job title] decides who will be the contract owner for each contract
-- i.e. who will be responsible for a particular supplier or partner.

### Training and awareness

Contract owner decides which employees of suppliers and partners need
security awareness and training.

The CEO is responsible to provide all the training and raising of
awareness of those employees.

### Monitoring and review

Contract owner must regularly check and monitor the level of service and
fulfillment of security clauses by suppliers or partners, reports and
records created by the supplier/partner, as well as audit the supplier
or partner at least once a year.

All the security incidents related to the partner's/supplier's job must
be forwarded immediately to the CEO.

### Changes or termination of supplier services

Contract owner proposes changes or termination of the contract, and the
CEO makes the final decision. If necessary, the CEO will perform a new
risk assessment before the changes are accepted.

### Removal of access rights / return of assets

When the contract is changed or terminated, the access rights for
employees of partners/suppliers must be removed according to the Access
Control Policy.

Further, when the contract is changed or terminated, the contract owner
must make sure all the equipment, software or information in electronic
or paper form is returned.
