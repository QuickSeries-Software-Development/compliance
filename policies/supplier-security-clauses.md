## For cloud service providers

In most cases, QuickSeries Publishing will obtain various Cloud Services
from third-party companies such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others.
These companies do not and will not accept special or custom Security
Controls that QuickSeries Publishing may wish to obtain specifically.

Security requirements are governed by the supplier's standard
contractual terms, including publicly available cloud service
agreements, security addenda, and privacy documentation.

Due to the size and market position of the supplier, contractual terms
are non-negotiable. The organization has reviewed and accepted the
supplier's standard security and privacy terms based on a risk
assessment and the supplier's recognized industry certifications.

Due to the non-negotiable nature of these agreements, QuickSeries
Publishing performs a risk-based review of the supplier's controls and
formally accepts any residual risks. This approach is consistent with
ISO/IEC 27001 supplier risk management principles.
