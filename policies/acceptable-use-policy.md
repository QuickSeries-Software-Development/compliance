## Acceptable use of information assets

### Definitions

**Information system** -- includes all servers and clients, network
infrastructure, system and application software, data, and other
computer subsystems and components that are owned or used by the
organization or that are under the organization's responsibility. The
use of an information system also includes the use of all internal or
external services, such as Internet access, e-mail, etc.

**Information assets** -- in the context of this Policy, the term
*information assets* is applied to information systems and other
information/equipment including paper documents, mobile phones, portable
computers, data storage media, etc.

### Acceptable use

Information assets may be used only for business needs with the purpose
of executing organization-related tasks.

In the context of a telework environment, the provided equipment is for
the sole use of the employee, in a business context only. It is
forbidden to allow family members, friends or other people in your home
office to access such equipment.

### Responsibility for assets

Each information asset has an owner designated in the Inventory of
Assets. The asset owner is responsible for the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of the information on the asset in question.

### Deletion of information

When no longer required, the asset owner must delete sensitive
information stored on his/her computer or mobile device.

### Prohibited activities

It is prohibited to use information assets in a manner that
unnecessarily takes up capacity, weakens the performance of the
information system, or poses a security threat. The following are some
examples of misuse of computer equipment that violate this policy:

- Using a computer account that you are not authorized to use.

- Obtaining a password for a computer account without the consent of the
  account owner

- Password protecting any file or computer system without authorization.

- Using the company network to gain unauthorized access to any computer
  systems.

- Knowingly performing an act which will interfere with the normal
  operation of computers, terminals, peripherals or networks.

- Knowingly running or installing on any computer system or network, or
  giving to another user, a program intended to damage or to place
  excessive load on a computer system or network. This includes but is
  not limited to programs known as computer viruses, Trojan horses and
  worms.

- Attempting to circumvent data protection schemes or uncover security
  loopholes.

- Installing software or setting up a computer that bypasses the
  company firewall (for example: personal VPN software, tunnels) or that
  allows remote connectivity from outside of the company or your home
  office like remote desktop services, file hosting/sharing services and
  tools.

- Violating terms of applicable software licensing agreements or
  copyright laws.

- Deliberately wasting computing resources.

- Using electronic mail to harass others.

- Masking the identity of an account or machine.

- Posting materials on electronic bulletin boards that violate existing
  laws or QuickSeries' codes of conduct.

- Attempting to monitor or tamper with another user's electronic
  communications, or reading, copying, changing, or deleting another
  user's files or software without the explicit agreement of the owner.

### Taking assets off-site

Equipment, information or software, regardless of its form or storage
medium, may not be taken off-site or outside your home office without
prior written permission by the IT Director.

As long as said assets are outside the organization, they have to be
controlled by the person who was granted permission for their removal.

### Return of assets upon termination of contract

Upon termination of an employment contract or other contract on the
basis of which various equipment, software or information in electronic
or paper form is used, the user must return all such information assets
to the IT Team.

### Backup procedure

The employee must ensure a constant internet connection so we can
automatically backup the computer in the home office at least once a
day.

### Antivirus/malware protection

The Avast Anti-Virus solution must be installed on each employee
workstation, with activated automatic updates.

### Authorizations for information system use

Users of the information system may only access those information system
assets for which they have been explicitly authorized by the asset
owner.

Users may use the information system only for purposes for which they
have been authorized, i.e. for which they have been granted access
rights.

Users must not take part in activities which may be used to bypass
information system security controls. Since the user account on the
computer doesn't have administrative privileges, users are not
authorized to:

- change operating system settings,

- disable disk encryption,

- format the disk and/or reinstall the operating system,

- attempt to circumvent any security feature that may have been
  installed,

- install software other than the ones provided or approved by the IT
  department.

### Quick Connect System usage

While QuickConnect is not physically linked to the internal network
infrastructure of the QuickSeries business operations, similar
requirements and restrictions apply:

- Quick Connect may only be used by authorized employees for official
  business purposes.

- Employees must not share access credentials, API keys, or session
  tokens with unauthorized users or third parties.

- Use of the application must comply with all applicable laws,
  regulatory requirements, and contractual obligations.

- All usage must comply with QuickSeries' Privacy Policy and data
  handling agreements.

### User account responsibilities

The user must not, directly or indirectly, allow another person to use
his/her access rights, i.e., username, and must not use another person's
username and/or password. The use of group user names is forbidden.

The owner of the user account is its user, who is responsible for its
use, and all transactions performed through this user account.

### Password responsibilities

Users must apply the following good security practices when selecting
and using passwords:

- passwords must not be disclosed to other persons, including management
  and system administrators

- passwords must not be written down, and should only be stored in the
  provided password manager (Bitwarden or 1Password).

- user-generated passwords must not be distributed through any channel
  (by oral, written, or electronic distribution, etc.)

- passwords must be changed if there are indications that the passwords
  or the system may have been compromised -- in that case a security
  incident must be reported

- strong passwords must be selected, in the following way:

  - a password must not be a dictionary word, dialectal or jargon word
    from any language, or any of these words written backwards

  - passwords must not be based on personal data (e.g. date of birth,
    address, name of family member, etc.)

  - use of a passphrase consisting of a minimum of 3 words is preferable
    to password

  - Minimum length is 8 characters

  - Allow users to use spaces, all printable ASCII, and Unicode
    characters (to enable passphrases).

- password must be changed at first log-on to a system

- passwords must not be stored in an automated log-on system (e.g. macro
  or browser)

- passwords used for private purposes must not be used for business
  purposes

### Clear desk and clear screen policy

All information classified as "Internal use," "Restricted," or
"Confidential" as specified in the Information Classification Policy
are regarded as sensitive in this item.

Refer to the "Clear Desk and Clear Screen" policy.

### Internet use

Internet connectivity presents risks that must be addressed to
safeguard our vital information assets, preserve the integrity of our
corporate reputation online, and maintain our employee's productivity
level.

When at the office or working from home on QuickSeries equipment,
Internet usage is intended for job-related activities only.

Abusive or irresponsible use of our Internet connection may be
sanctioned with a revocation of the permission to work from home, and,
in extreme cases, warrant termination.

### Internet Use Responsibility

All internet data that is written, sent or received through our computer
systems is part of official QuickSeries records. That means that we can
be legally required to show that information to law enforcement or other
parties. Therefore, employees should always make sure that the business
information contained in internet email messages and other transmissions
is accurate, appropriate, ethical and legal.

The equipment, services and technology used to access the internet are
the property of QuickSeries. Therefore, we reserve the right to monitor
how employees use the internet. We also reserve the right to find and
read any data that is written, sent or received through our online
connections or that is stored in our computer systems.

Employees may not use the internet to write, send, read or receive data
that contains content that could be considered discriminatory,
offensive, obscene, threatening, harassing, intimidating or disruptive
to any employee or other person or illegal in any means.

Examples of unacceptable content include (but are not limited to) sexual
comments or images, racial slurs, gender-specific comments or other
comments or images that could reasonably offend someone on the basis of
race, age, sex, religious or political beliefs, national origin,
disability, sexual orientation or any other characteristic protected by
law.

An employee that uses the internet in a way that violates the laws
applicable in Canada or the United States or QuickSeries' policies will
be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of
employment. The employee may also be held personally liable for
violating this policy.

The following are some examples of prohibited activities that violate
this internet policy:

- Sending or posting discriminatory, harassing, or threatening messages
  or images.

- Using the organization's time and resources for personal gain.

- Stealing, using, or disclosing someone else's code or password
  without authorization

- Copying, pirating, streaming or downloading software and electronic
  files without permission

- Sending or posting confidential material, trade secrets or proprietary
  information outside of the organization

- Violating copyright laws or any other applicable laws in Canada or the
  United States.

- Failing to observe software licensing agreements

### Copyright

QuickSeries has licensed the use of certain commercial software
application programs for business purposes (for example: Microsoft Word,
FileMaker, Adobe Creative Suite, etc). Third parties retain the
ownership and distribution rights to such software. No employee may
create, use or distribute copies of such software that are not in
compliance with the license agreements for the software. Violation of
this policy can lead to disciplinary action, up to and including
dismissal. The permission granted to the employees to use these
third-party software programs does not in any way grant any additional
ownership privileges.

Reproduction or distribution of copyrighted works, including, but not
limited to, images, text, or software, without permission of the owner
is an infringement of American and Canadian copyright laws and is
subject to civil damages and criminal penalties including fines and
imprisonment.

### Mobile computing

Usage of mobile devices, including phones and laptops is covered in our
BYOD Policy.

### Teleworking & work from home

#### Introduction

Teleworking means that information and communication equipment is used
to enable employees to perform their work outside the organization,
including work from home. Teleworking does not include the use of mobile
phones outside the organization's premises.

QuickSeries Publishing provides all employees working from home some IT
equipment (computer, monitor, phones, iPod, network devices, etc.), as
well as computer files, email account, cloud services accounts, software
and network access. All of these components are the property of
QuickSeries and will remain the exclusive property of QuickSeries. They
are also subjected to a strict usage policy that every employee at
QuickSeries must comply with:

- Each employee provided with equipment by QuickSeries is responsible
  for the physical security of such equipment.

- The provided equipment is for the sole use of the employee, in a
  business context only. It is forbidden to allow family members,
  friends or other people in your home office to access such equipment.

- It is suggested that employees notify your home insurance company of
  your current telework situation as they will need to cover QuickSeries
  equipment in case of damage or loss.

- At any time, the employee may be required to return the equipment to
  QuickSeries.

#### Additional rules for teleworking

Employees are responsible for maintaining a secure environment in their
home office to ensure personal devices cannot access sensitive data on
QuickSeries equipment or networks. This includes the following mandatory
measures:

- Use secure passwords for your home router, QuickSeries computer, and
  Wi-Fi connection.

- Do not configure personal email accounts on QuickSeries computers.

- Do not configure QuickSeries email accounts on personal devices (e.g.,
  phones, tablets) unless explicitly managed by the IT department (see
  exceptions in the following section).

- Avoid shared drives or direct connections between QuickSeries
  equipment and other personal devices at home.

Failure to adhere to this policy will be treated as a serious violation
of company security protocols. Compliance is essential to safeguard
QuickSeries data and systems.

### Monitoring the use of information and communication systems

All data which is created, stored, sent or received through the
information system or other organization's communication systems,
including various applications, e-mail, Internet, fax, etc., whether it
is personal or not, is considered the ownership of QuickSeries
Publishing.

Users agree that authorized persons from the organization may access all
such data, and that access by such persons will not be considered a
violation of the users' privacy.

The organization may use specialized tools for the purpose of
identifying and blocking forbidden methods of communication and
filtering forbidden content.

### Incidents

Each employee who is in contact with data and/or systems of QuickSeries
Publishing must report any system weakness, incident or event pointing
to a possible incident as specified in the Incident Management
Procedure.
