description: >
  As we were in the process of replacing our website with new technology
  (from Beanstalk to EC2/Docker), Justin accidentally deleted the prod
  Beanstalk environment.

resolution: >
  Pointed quickseries.com to a different load balancer. Configured the load
  balancer to show a maintenance page. Worked on getting the new technology
  replaced for the prod environment. Laecio and Justin worked on reconfiguring
  the code. Eric and Kyle made sure the infrastructure was setup and secure.
