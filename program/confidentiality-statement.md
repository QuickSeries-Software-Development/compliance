# Confidentiality Statement

I acknowledge that, in the course of my employment, I may have access to information classified as restricted or confidential under QuickSeries Publishing's defined information classification policy. I agree to protect the restriction or confidentiality of such information and to use it solely for authorized business purposes. I will not disclose confidential information to any third party except as permitted by company policy, contractual obligations, or applicable laws and regulations.

I will use information received during my employment only for the purpose of performing my work responsibilities adequately.

I will treat as especially confidential any information received in writing or orally, whether technical, business, legal, organizational, personal or any other information that could result in damage to QuickSeries Publishing in case of disclosure to unauthorized persons, regardless of whether the information is classified as confidential or not.

I will share the confidential information only with authorized persons of QuickSeries Publishing.

I will handle the confidential information in accordance with document "9.06 -- Information Classification Policy".

Should I be required to cooperate with third persons, I will share confidential information only in accordance with Policy of Handling Classified information and other documents of QuickSeries Publishing.

Should I be compelled by a decision of any court in jurisdiction over the dispute, or by any other competent judicial, government or regulatory body, or if I should be legally obliged to disclose any confidential information, I will immediately notify QuickSeries Publishing in writing.

If any obligations under this Statement are violated, I will immediately upon learning of such violation notify my immediate supervisor and/or QuickSeries Publishing.

If as an employee of the sales teams or having to interact directly with external contacts and sales prospects or clients, I shall respect the following guidelines:

- No sharing of confidential information via personal email, messaging apps or personal cloud storage.
- No forwarding of customer or internal documents without authorization.
- No disclosure of one customer's information to another (even anonymized, unless pre-approved).
- Not disclose any trade-secrets, plans or company strategies without prior approval.
- Share only on a need-to-know basis any pricing information and specific competitive offerings.
- Not export or copy of any client information outside of company approved communication channels, like the ERP (FileMaker database), company email or approved file sharing environment.
- Share only non-confidential information that is publicly available, lawfully received from a third party or approved in writing or part of the company marketing and outreach material.

I understand and agree that my confidentiality obligations apply during and after my employment and continue in perpetuity with respect to all information classified as confidential or restricted under QuickSeries Publishing information classification policy, except where disclosure is required by law.

I acknowledge that I may be held civilly liable, in accordance with applicable law, for any actual and demonstrable damages suffered by QuickSeries Publishing as a result of my unauthorized disclosure or misuse of confidential information. This obligation applies to the extent permitted by the Civil Code of Quebec and applicable labor legislation.
