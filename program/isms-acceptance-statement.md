I hereby declare that I am fully familiar with the ISMS Policy of QuickSeries Publishing, and with other documents that have been or are to be published as part of the Information Security Management System:

I hereby declare that I will adhere to the ISMS Policy and all other stated documents. I am aware that non-adherence to any part of this Statement will be considered a breach of duties and that disciplinary action will be invoked in each case of non-adherence.
