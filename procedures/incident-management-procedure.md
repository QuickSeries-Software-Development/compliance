# Incident Management Procedure

## Purpose, scope and users

The purpose of this document is to ensure quick detection of security events and weaknesses, and quick reaction and response to security incidents.

This document is applied to the entire Information Security Management System (ISMS) scope, i.e. to all employees and other assets used within the ISMS scope. Users of this document are all employees of QuickSeries Publishing.

## Reference documents

- ISO/IEC 27001 standard, clauses 7.4, A.5.7, A.5.24, A.5.25, A.5.26, A.5.27, A.5.28, A.6.4, and A.6.8
- Information Security Policy
- List of Legal, Regulatory, Contractual and Other Requirements

## Incident management

An information security incident is a "single or a series of unwanted or unexpected information security events that have a significant probability of compromising business operations and threatening information security" (ISO/IEC 27000:2018).

### Receipt and classification of incidents, weaknesses and events

Each employee who is in contact with information, systems, or sensitive areas of QuickSeries Publishing must report any threat, system weakness, incident, or event that could lead to a possible incident in the following way:

1. all information and communication technology-related events must be reported to The IT Director
2. all other events must be reported to the CEO

Incidents, threats, weaknesses, and events must be reported by direct mean, i.e. phone, Slack or in person.

The person who received the information must classify it in the following way:

a) **CRITICAL:** data compromised, data loss, PII concerns (within 30 minutes of discovery)

b) **HIGH:** security breach, unauthorized access/use (within 30 minutes of discovery)

c) **LOW:** minor breach, alert, attempts at connecting/using our infrastructure (within 1 day)

CRITICAL and HIGH are incidents which can incur significant damage due to loss of confidentiality or integrity of information or may cause an interruption in the availability of information and/or processes for an unacceptable period of time.

LOW categorizes incidents which cannot significantly impact confidentiality or integrity of information, and cannot cause long-term unavailability.

### Treatment process

QuickSeries maintains an internal incident response capability to ensure prompt detection, reporting, and mitigation of cybersecurity incidents affecting systems that store, process, or transmit Federal Contract Information (FCI) and other sensitive information (PII, credit cards information, etc). All employees are required to participate in incident awareness training and must report potential incidents immediately to the IT Department.

The following steps outline the incident response process:

#### Identification and Reporting

- Employees are trained to recognize common cybersecurity threats, including phishing, malware alerts, suspicious login attempts, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- Detection mechanisms include Avast antivirus alerts, VPN access logs, Google Workspace and Slack security notifications, and employee reports.
- Employees must report any suspected incident (e.g., phishing emails, malware alerts, unauthorized access) immediately to IT through the helpdesk system.
- Incidents are categorized based on severity (High, Medium, Low) and business impact.
- Security incidents are reported first to IT Helpdesk by email to `support@quickseries.com`
  - then escalated to IT Director/CISO
  - then to senior management (aka "G7") as needed.

#### Response Timeline

- High severity incidents (e.g., breach of FCI): Response initiated within 2 hours.
- Medium severity (e.g., suspicious login attempts): Response initiated within 8 hours.
- Low severity (e.g., malware detection by antivirus): Response initiated within one business day.

#### Containment

- Upon receiving an alert, IT isolates affected systems from the network if necessary to prevent further spread (e.g., disabling VPN access, quarantining devices in MDM).
- Affected user accounts may be temporarily locked or password-reset as a precaution.
- Access to cloud systems (e.g., Google Workspace, Slack) is reviewed to assess the scope of exposure.

#### Investigation and Analysis

- IT investigates incidents, collects logs, and documents findings. IT then reviews system logs (VPN, endpoint, cloud access logs), recent file activity, and any alerts generated by Avast or cloud monitoring tools.
- The source, impact, and scope of the incident are documented.
- If sensitive information is involved, the incident is escalated for immediate remediation and notification to appropriate stakeholders.

#### Eradication and Recovery

- Malware or unauthorized tools are removed using approved anti-malware software.
- System configurations are validated against baselines and restored if altered.
- Affected systems are re-imaged or repaired as needed and brought back online only after verifying they are secure.
- Passwords and credentials are reset, and access is restored only to authorized users.

#### Notification and Reporting

- The incident and response actions are documented internally.
- Leadership and affected users are notified of the resolution and any required follow-up actions.
- If contractually required, or if FCI was compromised, incident details may be shared with the relevant customers, the contracting officers or, in case of DoD, any official required, in accordance with DFARS reporting timelines.

#### Post-Incident Review

- Within five business days, the IT team performs a post-incident review to assess response effectiveness.
- Controls and procedures are updated as needed.
- Security awareness tips or corrective actions are communicated to staff via internal channels (e.g., Slack, QuickConnect).

#### Incident Documentation

QuickSeries maintains documentation for all reported incidents, including initial reports, response actions, logs reviewed, and remediation steps taken. These records are stored securely in a Confluence page and retained according to internal data retention policies.

### Simulation Exercise

QuickSeries shall conduct periodic incident response simulations to evaluate the efficiency of the incident management process, reinforce personnel readiness, and ensure alignment with internal security policies and compliance obligations (including ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27002 control 5.24, and SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria for Security and Availability).

#### Simulation Requirements

Simulations shall be scheduled and conducted at least annually, or more frequently as determined by risk assessments or changes in the threat landscape.

Exercises shall include realistic but non-disruptive scenarios such as:

- Ransomware attacks
- Data exfiltration attempts
- Cloud service outages
- Insider threats

Simulations may be tabletop, functional (limited live execution), or full-scale exercises, depending on the objective.

### Disciplinary actions

The President must invoke a disciplinary process for each violation of security rules.

### Collection of evidence

The IT Director will define the rules on how to identify, collect and preserve evidence that will be accepted as evidence in legal and other proceedings.
