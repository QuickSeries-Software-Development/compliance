- **Home office**

  - Employees are required to follow the following policies to ensure a secure work environment:
    - 09.02 Clear Desk and Clear Screen Policy
    - 09.01 Acceptable Use Policy

### Continuous monitoring

CEO is responsible for continuous monitoring of secure areas in order to detect unauthorized access or suspicious behavior, through the following means:

- Alarm system
- Security cameras

At the head office, the warehouse manager oversees visitors, ensures they sign the visitor log, and arranges escorts when required.

In case the CEO is not available, the President and the IT Director are also available to support continuous monitoring.

### Access of visitors

Persons who are not employed in QuickSeries Publishing (further: visitors) must obtain access according to the Access Control Policy.

Visitors may enter the secure areas and stay in those areas only in the presence of a designated employee -- this employee must accompany the visitor throughout their whole stay in the secure area.

The precise time of visitors' entry and exit from the secure areas will be logged in Visitor Log by the warehouse manager.

### Prohibited activities

In secure areas it is not allowed to:

- archive a larger amount of paper materials;
- store flammable materials or equipment;
- use any kind of heating devices;
- smoking or vaping.

### Periodic checks

If the head office hasn't been used for more than 2 weeks, the CEO needs to check if it complies with security and safety requirements.
