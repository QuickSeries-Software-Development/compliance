# Disciplinary Process

## Purpose, Scope and Users

To establish a fair and transparent disciplinary process for addressing employee misconduct, including violations related to information security policies and procedures.

This process applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who have access to company systems, data, and physical premises.

## Reference documents

- ISO/IEC 27001:2022, clause A.6.4

## Principles of the Disciplinary Process

All disciplinary actions shall be:

- **Fair and objective** -- Decisions must be based on evidence and follow due process.
- **Proportionate** -- The disciplinary measure should correspond to the severity of the misconduct.
- **Consistent** -- Similar offenses should result in similar disciplinary actions.
- **Confidential** -- All proceedings shall be treated with discretion to protect the privacy of the individuals involved.
- **Compliant** -- The process must align with company policies, employment laws, and information security requirements.

## Disciplinary Process Steps

### Step 1: Identification of the Issue

- Misconduct is identified through observations, reports, audits, or security monitoring.
- If the issue relates to information security, an internal security incident report should be created.

### Step 2: Preliminary Assessment

- HR and the relevant department (e.g., IT Security for security breaches) conduct an initial review.
- If needed, fact-finding interviews are held with parties involved.
- If the issue is minor, informal resolution (e.g., guidance or retraining) may be considered instead of formal disciplinary action.

### Step 3: Formal Investigation

- An internal investigation is conducted to gather evidence.
- The employee is informed in writing about the alleged misconduct.
- The employee has the right to respond and provide their account of the incident.
- A risk assessment is performed to determine whether the issue has security, legal, or regulatory implications.

### Step 4: Disciplinary Hearing (If required)

- A disciplinary meeting is scheduled where:
  - The employee can present their case.
  - Witnesses or supporting documents may be reviewed.
  - HR ensures fairness and compliance with labor laws.

### Step 5: Decision & Disciplinary Measures

Based on the severity and impact of the incident, the following disciplinary actions may apply:

- Verbal warning (minor offenses).
- Written warning (moderate offenses, repeat violations).
- Suspension (for serious offenses, pending further review).
- Termination of employment (for gross misconduct or severe security breaches).
- Legal action (if necessary, in cases of fraud, theft, or major security violations).

For information security-related issues, the corrective actions may include:

- Revocation of access rights (if necessary).
- Mandatory security training or retraining.
- Enhanced monitoring of the employees' activities.

Disciplinary measures must comply and be in accordance with the province of Quebec Labor laws at all times.

### Step 7: Documentation & Record-Keeping

- All disciplinary actions must be documented securely and confidentially.
- Records must comply with data protection laws and be retained in the employee's employment record for the duration of employment plus 2 years.

## Information Security Considerations

- Employees must be aware that violations of security policies, misuse of data, or failure to follow security controls may result in disciplinary actions.
- Security incidents should be reported immediately to the IT Director.
- HR and IT should collaborate to ensure that security-related offenses are addressed appropriately.
